## Overview

Im recreating my first programming projects. 
Back in 2020 i got into college and learned the basics of programming using a C Flavoured C++. 
As you may expect my beginner projects were really bad. 
Now, as a ML Engineer i tend to use Python and C++ a lot so i decided to test myself vs the old me by remaking some old C++ projects.

Tic-Tac-Toe was my third assignment and the objective was to make a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
I will not try to implement more stuff like AI in this one (this will come in another project). 

The rules of the assignment:

1. Two Player Game.
2. Use 2D Arrays.
3. if a player completes a line, column or diagonal he wins.
4. if none of the players completes any of the winning conditions above the game ends on a draw.
5. a player can't place a piece in a spot that another piece sits in.


These were the rules to get a max score in class, i will be mantaining those.

I don't know where my old code is but for what i can remember it was one of my best projects in that period.
